## [OnePlus 3T](https://www.oneplus.com/global/support/spec/oneplus-3t) - the past

I used a OnePlus 3T for 5 years and 3 months (1907 days in total). It was a great device, but once I couldn't answer phone calls I knew: it was time to replace it. <!--more-->

I'm extremely happy, that it lasted so long because I think using your existing tools is a key to sustainable living.

The phone was repaired two times, both of them because I dropped it, and there was no protective case on it:

1. The rear camera glass was broken and repaired
2. I broke the display, so it was replaced, including the battery, which became old after three years of daily usage.

I'm glad that I choose reparation in both cases, buying a new one was not the solution at that time. This way I could reduce my e-waste, and give this amazing device new life.

## [Fairphone 4](https://shop.fairphone.com/en/buy-fairphone-4) - the future

I've been following [Fairphone](https://www.fairphone.com/en/) for a few years now, and I'm sure that the way they're thinking about the future of phones and other electronic devices is excellent in terms of sustainability.

They build long-lasting phones with a long support cycle (my Fairphone 4 has 5 years Extended Warranty), using fair raw materials and with iFixit 10/10 score repairability.

I've been using it for a month and confirmed that it's a robust, cool-looking, great device.

I hope it will be my extended arm at least as long as the previous one.
