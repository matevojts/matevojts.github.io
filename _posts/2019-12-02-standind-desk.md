I was so joyful today morning seeing the first snow of the winter. The whole city was white, and especially the inner court of the office building was amazingly snowy.

But there was one more shiny white surprise today: finally, I received my new sit/stand desk from Ikea.

I've been waiting for it since ages, but I decided to buy it a couple of days ago, and now it became real!

I think it will be healthful, additionally I expect, that I won't stuck in front of the computer just because I wanted to check 1 ingredient of the dinner...

The cable management is a disaster yet, and also I'd like to install my PC below the desk, not to steal the free space. But way better then before.

I'm typing these characters standing, and smiling.

I'll update you soon how is it going with it!

And my old desk deserves a standing ovation: I received it 24 years ago, in 1995, when I entered elementary school. It was supporting me in 3 different cities, and it's still in pretty good condition. Thanks for it!
