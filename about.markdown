A long time ago in 2017, a friend of mine showed me what he was doing in his job: developing Android apps.

Right now I'm doing the same as a professional Android dev, with memories like the first lines written in Kotlin, and when RxJava became a thing for me.

I fell in love with Git, it's amazing to see the many little steps leading to an app, which helps people in day-to-day life.
